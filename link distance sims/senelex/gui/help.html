<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Installation</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The Localization GUI requires MATLAB version 7.x (tested for x=2) and the 
Optimization Toolbox to run properly.&nbsp; Without the Optimization Toolbox,
Cramer-Rao bounds can still be calculated, but maximum likelihood estimation will
not be functional.&nbsp; The SeNeLEx files may be extracted anywhere 
on the user's system.  To run the program, cd into the gui directory (>>cd senelex\gui),
and type "localization_gui" from the matlab commandline (>>localization_gui).  Starting
the program by double-clicking from either the Matlab or OS file explorer does not
reliably work.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>Usage</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>The following two figures present the two main windows of the GUI with key 
features marked by letters and described below.</P>

    <TD><B>Description</B></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>A</TD>
    <TD>From the node selection panel the user can select whether to place 
      arrays (sensors), sources (emitters), or co-located nodes (lo-located 
      array and source). Once a node type is selected, they can be placed in the 
      scene by clicking at the desired grid location (B).</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>B</TD>
    <TD>The sensor scene. Nodes placed here can be edited by right clicking on 
      them. This allows the user to set certain features of the node as known, 
      such as the node's orientation or position. Also the scene connectivity is 
      illustrated by blue lines connecting an array to any source that it is in 
      range of hearing. General connectivity can be controlled from the 
      configuration screen while individual links may be deleted or restored 
      here from the context menu brought up by right-clicking links or nodes. 
  </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>C</TD>
    <TD>Pressing the "calculate bounds" button will calculate the Cramer Rao 
      lower bound for the location estimates, which are drawn as 2-sigma 
      ellipses around the nodes. The user will be prompted to set more locations 
      known if needed. Pressing the "localize" button calculates a maximum 
      likelihood estimate of the source locations based of off simulated arrival 
      times, arrival angles, or signal strengths as needed. The estimates are 
      plotted as x's in the scene. This button may be pressed several times to 
      display several realizations simultaneously, or use "File-&gt;Localize N 
      times..."</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>D</TD>
    <TD>The zoom axes. Clicking on any node in the sensor scene will display 
      it and any estimates associated with it in the zoom axes.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>E</TD>
    <TD>Here the user can select whether to use signal times, angles, or 
      strengths in the localization process. This allows the user to evaluate 
      the relative performance of the various methods as well as investigate the 
      performance of hybrid schemes using multiple modes. The GUI enforces the 
      requirement that at least one modality be checked.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>F</TD>
    <TD>Actual and estimated parameters pertaining to the selected node. 
      Source nodes do not have orientations. Sensors and colocated sources 
  do.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>G</TD>
    <TD>Statistics about the entire sensor scene. 2-sigma statistics are 
      derived from the Cramer Rao lower bound. The absolute statistics come from 
      actual ML estimates. Orientation errors are only available when angle 
      information is used. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>H</TD>
    <TD>Menu Bar. Various options are available through the menu bar. In 
      particular the configuration screen is accessed through 
      "Config-&gt;Configure parameters..." Scenes may be saved and reloaded 
      through the "File" menu, and all sources may be given known or unknown 
      emission times via "Config-&gt;Mark all emission times..." option. This 
      allows for the evaluation of TDOA versus TOA scenarios. Various viewing 
      options are available from the "View" menu.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>I</TD>
    <TD>In this panel the user can select the standard deviation of the 
      arrival time observations to be used when "Use time information" is 
      checked on the main window. The propagation speed can also be changed 
      here. For example, acoustics may use a velocity and standard deviation of 
      340 m/s and 1ms respectively, and an RF system may have propagation 
      velocity 3e8 m/s with timing standard errors of 5ns. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>J</TD>
    <TD>The standard deviation of angle of arrival information. If angle 
      information is not being used, this value is ignored.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>K</TD>
    <TD>Parameters used in the received signal strength model which uses 
      log-distance pathloss plus log-normal shadowing as shown in panel M. These 
      parameters are ignored if "Use RSS information" is not checked on the main 
      window.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>L</TD>
    <TD>Connectivity determination. Here the user can select how the program 
      determines which sources can be heard by which arrays. Fully connected 
      means all sources are heard by all arrays. "k-sources" means that each 
      sensor can only hear emissions from the k-nearest sources. Similarly, all 
      sources less than a threshold distance can be heard by selecting the 
      distance threshold option. Individual links in the connectivity graph may 
      also be deleted by right-clicking on them in the main window.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>M</TD>
    <TD>By default SeNeLEx computes the maximum likelihood estimates of the node
	postiions using all available information as determined by the connectivity
	and measurement selection types (time, angles, and/or RSS).  Alternatively, 
	the user can define their own localization algorithm for SeNeLEx to call.  This
	function can exist anywhere on the Matlab path.  A function template is provided
	in senelex\engine\user_localization.m  </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>N</TD>
    <TD>This pannel summarizes the measurement models used in this program for 
      arrival times, arrival angles, received signal strengths. Only a subset of 
      these may be used depending on the selections on the main window.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>O</TD>
    <TD>Clicking "Apply" applies these settings to the nodes in the main 
      window. "Close" closes the configuration 
window.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
